# Parallelization with MPI and Performance Analysis

In the second part of this course an optimized parallel MPI-program had to be written as an improvement over a non-parallel code, conducting a series of row and column
operations on a generated matrix of size N=8192 using STEPS=200 iterations. The goal was to achieve a substantially faster execution time while maintaining the
functionality of the code.

The results are summarized in the report.
